# Vendor Perspective Update Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. RFI Wizard Questions (COMPLETED ✅)
**Before**: Questions assumed buyer perspective
- "What's the primary objective of this RFI?"
- "What's your timeline for this project?"
- "What's your approximate budget range?"

**After**: Questions now reflect vendor perspective
- "Which aspects of this RFI align best with your capabilities?"
- "What unique value can you bring to this opportunity?"
- "Have you worked with similar organizations or requirements?"
- "What's your initial approach to meeting their needs?"

### 2. AI Service RFI Prompt (COMPLETED ✅)
**Before**: Generated content as if issuing an RFI
**After**: Now explicitly states:
```
IMPORTANT: We are ${context.companyInfo?.company_name || 'the vendor'} RESPONDING TO an RFI from ${context.organizationName}.
We are NOT the buyer issuing the RFI - we are the seller/vendor preparing our response to their request for information.
```

### 3. RFI Document Structure (COMPLETED ✅)
**Before**: Default content for buyer issuing RFI
**After**: Updated to vendor response format:
- Introduction acknowledges receipt of RFI
- Company Overview highlights vendor capabilities
- Project Scope demonstrates understanding of buyer needs
- Next Steps express readiness to proceed

## Current Status

✅ **RFI Questions**: Fixed to vendor perspective
✅ **RFP Questions**: Already correct (win themes, differentiators, etc.)
✅ **AI Prompts**: Both RFI and RFP now explicitly state vendor perspective
✅ **Document Templates**: Updated to vendor response format

## Key Points

1. **Clear Role Definition**: System now clearly understands you are the VENDOR responding to RFIs/RFPs, not the buyer issuing them

2. **Consistent Messaging**: All prompts and questions now focus on:
   - Your capabilities and strengths
   - How you meet buyer requirements
   - Your competitive advantages
   - Your experience and track record

3. **AI Context**: Both RFI and RFP generation now include explicit instructions that you are the vendor creating a response to win business

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a new RFI project and go through the wizard
2. Verify questions ask about YOUR capabilities, not what you're seeking
3. Generate an RFI response and confirm it positions you as the vendor
4. Check that generated content focuses on winning the business

The system is now properly configured to help you WIN BUSINESS as a vendor responding to RFIs and RFPs!
