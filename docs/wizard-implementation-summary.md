# Step-by-Step Wizard Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

We've created an interactive, step-by-step wizard interface that guides users through the RFP/RFI creation process. This makes the system much more approachable for AI-skeptics by providing a structured, conversational experience.

## Key Features

### 1. **Welcome Card**
- Shows when users first enter a project with no documents
- Presents two clear options:
  - **Guided Wizard** (Recommended) - Step-by-step process with AI assistance
  - **Quick Generate** - Traditional upload-and-generate for experienced users
- Clearly explains benefits of each approach

### 2. **Step-by-Step Wizard**
The wizard has 4 clear steps:

#### Step 1: Upload Documents
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Support for multiple file types (PDF, Word, Excel, text)
- Web source URL input
- Shows uploaded files with green checkmarks
- Can't proceed without at least one document/source

#### Step 2: Provide Context (The Magic!)
- AI asks 4 targeted questions based on project type
- **For RFIs:**
  - What information are you hoping to gather?
  - What's your timeline?
  - Current pain points?
  - Budget range?
- **For RFPs:**
  - Main win theme?
  - Existing relationship with client?
  - Competitive advantages?
  - Any concerns about requirements?

- Features that build trust:
  - "Why am I asking?" explanations for each question
  - Quick answer buttons for common responses
  - Skip button if they don't want to answer
  - Shows progress (Question 2 of 4)
  - Friendly bot avatar and conversational tone

#### Step 3: Review & Refine
- Shows summary of uploaded documents
- Displays all their answers
- Allows them to go back and change anything
- Confirms they're ready to generate

#### Step 4: Generate Document
- Clear call-to-action button
- Shows real-time progress updates
- Incorporates all their context into the generation

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
- Visual progress bar at the top showing completed steps
- Real-time status messages during generation:
  - "Analyzing document content..."
  - "Summarizing large documents..."
  - "Incorporating your responses..."
  - "Generating AI content..."

### 4. **Integration with Existing System**
- Chat context is passed to the AI generation
- User responses are incorporated into prompts
- Makes the output more targeted and relevant
- Works with all existing features (summarization, company profile, etc.)

## Benefits for AI-Skeptics

1. **Feels Familiar** - Like filling out a form or survey
2. **Maintains Control** - They guide the process with their answers
3. **Transparency** - Can see why AI asks questions
4. **Not Intimidating** - Step-by-step removes overwhelm
5. **Shows Value** - Clear connection between their input and better output

## How It Works

1. User enters project → Sees welcome card
2. Chooses "Guided Wizard" → Enters step-by-step flow
3. Uploads documents in a friendly interface
4. Answers 4 simple questions with AI guidance
5. Reviews everything before generating
6. Gets a highly customized RFP/RFI based on their specific context

## Technical Implementation

- Created `RFPWizard` component with step management
- Created `WelcomeCard` component for onboarding
- Updated AI prompts to incorporate chat responses
- Modified generation endpoints to accept chat context
- Maintained backward compatibility with "Quick Generate"

The wizard makes the AI feel like a helpful colleague asking smart questions, rather than a mysterious black box. Users feel engaged and in control throughout the process!
