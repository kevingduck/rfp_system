# Citation and Company Info Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hallucinated Citations
**Problem**: The AI was creating fake citations like:
- `[Source: Case-Study-MajorBank.pdf, Project Overview section]`
- `[Source: Standard-SOW.docx, timeline section]`
- `[Source: Case-Study-StateAgency.pdf, Client Overview section]`

**Solution**: 
- Removed example citations from AI prompts that referenced non-existent files
- Added a list of valid sources that the AI can cite from
- Implemented strict citation validation that removes any citations not in the valid sources list

### 2. Incorrect Company Information
**Problem**: 
- AI claimed "50+ engineers" when company settings said "12 people total"
- AI said "over 15 years" when company info said "24 years experience"

**Solution**:
- Added explicit company facts section in AI prompts with exact values
- Instructions to use ONLY the provided company facts
- Anti-hallucination rules preventing invention of statistics

### 3. Knowledge Base Content Not Being Used
**Problem**: Knowledge base files were mentioned but their content wasn't actually included in prompts

**Solution**:
- Modified knowledge base integration to include actual file content
- Added summarization for large knowledge base files
- Properly formatted knowledge base content with filenames for citation

### 4. Real-time Progress Updates
**Problem**: Progress indicators weren't updating in real-time during generation

**Solution**:
- Fixed SSE (Server-Sent Events) parsing with proper buffering
- Added console logging for debugging
- Updated initial status messages to match expected progress steps

### 5. Draft Persistence
**Problem**: Drafts weren't persisted and had to be regenerated on each page visit

**Solution**:
- Created draft storage in database
- Added API endpoints for fetching and deleting drafts
- UI shows existing drafts with view/delete options
- Draft edits are saved back to database

## Code Changes

### 1. `/src/lib/ai-service.ts`
- Added `validSources` list building for citation validation
- Implemented `validateAndCleanCitations()` method
- Updated prompts with explicit company facts and anti-hallucination rules
- Modified knowledge base integration to include actual content

### 2. `/src/pages/project/[id].tsx`
- Added `fetchExistingDraft()` function
- Added draft management UI (View Draft, Delete Draft buttons)
- Shows draft status with generation date
- Fixed SSE parsing for real-time updates

### 3. `/src/pages/api/projects/[id]/draft.ts`
- New API endpoint for draft CRUD operations
- GET: Fetch existing draft
- DELETE: Remove draft
- PUT: Update draft sections

### 4. `/src/components/DraftPreview.tsx`
- Updated save functionality to use correct API endpoint
- Saves edits back to database

## Testing Checklist

1. **Citation Validation**
   - [ ] Generate a document and verify all citations reference actual uploaded files
   - [ ] Check that no fake document names appear in citations
   - [ ] Verify Company Settings citations appear as `[Source: Company Settings]`

2. **Company Info Accuracy**
   - [ ] Verify team size matches exactly what's in settings
   - [ ] Verify years of experience matches exactly
   - [ ] Check that no invented statistics appear

3. **Knowledge Base Usage**
   - [ ] Upload knowledge base files and verify their content is used
   - [ ] Check citations reference knowledge base files correctly

4. **Draft Persistence**
   - [ ] Generate a draft and refresh the page
   - [ ] Verify "View Draft" button appears
   - [ ] Test editing and saving draft sections
   - [ ] Test deleting drafts

5. **Real-time Progress**
   - [ ] Generate a document and watch progress indicators
   - [ ] Verify each step lights up as it progresses
   - [ ] Check console for SSE debugging messages

## Prevention Measures

1. **Explicit Valid Sources**: AI can only cite from documents actually provided
2. **Citation Validation**: Post-processing removes any invalid citations
3. **Strict Company Facts**: AI must use exact values provided, no approximations
4. **Anti-Hallucination Rules**: Clear instructions against inventing information
5. **Temperature 0.1**: Near-deterministic generation for factual accuracy
