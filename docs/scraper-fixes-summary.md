# Scraper & Knowledge Base Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Knowledge Base 500 Error
**Problem**: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/company-knowledge 500 (Internal Server Error)`

**Solution**: 
- Added table existence check in the API
- Returns empty array if table doesn't exist
- Added migration to setup.sh script

**To Fix**: Run in the rfp_system directory:
```bash
npx ts-node src/lib/migrate-knowledge-base.ts
```

### 2. Enhanced Converged Networks Scraper

**Problem**: Only scraped single page, needed comprehensive multi-page scraping

**Solution**: Created `ConvergedNetworksScraper` class that:
- Scrapes multiple pages (/, /about, /services, /solutions, etc.)
- Extracts and cleans data from all pages
- Combines information intelligently
- Provides fallback defaults

**Features**:
- **Multi-page crawling**: Up to 10 key pages
- **Smart extraction**: 
  - Company description from about pages
  - Services from service listings and keyword detection
  - Capabilities from technical content
  - Differentiators from "Why Choose Us" sections
  - Experience from founding year or years in business
  - Certifications from partner mentions
  - Contact info using regex patterns
- **Data cleanup**: Removes duplicates, formats nicely
- **Fallback defaults**: Sensible defaults if content not found

## How It Works

### Scraping Process
1. Click "Import from Converged Networks"
2. Scraper visits multiple pages:
   - Homepage
   - /about or /about-us

3. Extracts relevant content from each page
4. Combines and deduplicates information
